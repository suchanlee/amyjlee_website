Our goal was to unveil the art world to the public and encourage artists, galleries and viewers to interact. The project was quite immense and complicated. We are grateful for the interest and help from the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art and local galleries of Ithaca, NY. Unfortunately, it became difficult to maintain the project after the team members had graduated and we werenâ€™t able to fulfill the final launch.</p>\n\n<h2>Site Architecture</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/architecture.png\" alt=\"Site architecture for TE\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Onboarding Process</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/started1.png\" alt=\"Onboarding for TE 1 of 3\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/started2.png\" alt=\"Onboarding for TE 2 of 3\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/started3.png\" alt=\"Onboarding for TE 3 of 3\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Gallery List View</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/galleries.png\" alt=\"Gallery list view\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Gallery Detail View</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/galleries.png\" alt=\"Gallery list view\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Image View</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/image_detail.png\" alt=\"Image detail view\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/theexhibition/image_comments.png\" alt=\"Image comments view\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n";

It provides 4 ways for users to talk to doctors:\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Send a message</li>\n  <li>Schedule a virtual appointment</li>\n  <li>Hop on a call with a doctor online at the moment</li>\n  <li>Post an anonymous question</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n  It's important for the users to know these four options and their prices and triage the best method of consult for their case. The workflow of triaging the best consult method is called <b>Ask Docs</b>. It is the most heavily advertised feature of the HealthTap app.\n</p>\n\n<p>My first project at HealthTap was to redesign this flow of the app.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/01-old.png\" alt=\"What Ask Docs looked like when I joined\">\n<figcaption>What Ask Docs looked like when I joined</figcaption>\n\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>When I started working on this project, I found two issues:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Low conversion rate: more than 50% of the users did not complete the Ask Docs flow</li>\n  <li>Angry customers: users left angry App Store reviews and low NPS (net promoter score)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/disection-01.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/disection-02.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/disection-03.png\">\n\n<h2>Why low conversion rate?</h2>\n\n<h4>Users found the flow and the results to be complicated and hard to understand.</h4>\n<p>The flow required users to make a series of decisions. The decision points did not reflect the way people usually seek help and instead was based on the product architecture. After hurdling through these decision points, the results were often unsatisfying. They often couldn't find the service they were looking for or had trouble which consult option was the best.</p>\n\n<h4>Confusing and unexpectedly changing UI</h4>\n<p>The visibility of some features were based on doctors' online availability. Instead of displaying features as inactive, they were hidden away when doctors were offline. It made feature discoverability difficult and made the users feel disfamiliar with the app. For example, interviews show that it was difficult for users to learn that the on-demand service offered only when the doctors are online.</p>\n\n<h2>Why üò°?</h2>\n<h4>Advertised != Actual</h4>\n<p>Many of the unhappy reviews on the App Store read: <br/>\n<b>\"WHERE IS THE FREE OPTION?!\"</b></p>\n<P>While the app was heavily advertised for its \"free\" medical consultation, the free option was difficult to find in the app. So the users felt tricked, although the free option existed -- although in a different form from how it was advertised.</P>\n<p>Aligning with the user's expectations and clarifying the provided services seemed like a logical improvement.</p>\n\n<h2>Steps to solving the problem</h2>\n<h4>Gather feedback</h4>\n<p><b>I talked and stepped through the design with the Customer Success team</b> (the team to whom customers send their feedback and complaints). The team had already gathered and organized various user feedback for each product. Even before actually reaching out to the users, I was able to map out major problems and confusion on the Ask Docs flow.</p>\n<p><b>I conducted a series of interviews in ‚òïÔ∏è shops in Palo Alto</b>. Interviewees were first shown the current product. I then gave them a scenario (i.e. tell me how you‚Äôd use this app when you found out that you‚Äôve got a rash on your back) and asked them to walk through what they‚Äôd do in the current Ask Docs flow.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-01.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-01.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-01.png\">\n\n<p>Before jumping into mockups, I researched a few other products to benchmark. I looked into three different products (Avvo, One Medical, and Thumbtack) that were all focused around searching for an expert.</p>\n\n<p>I first started with making minimal tweaks to the existing design:</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-01.png\">\n\n<p>Then I thought about how we usually seek medical help or inquiries. What do I do when I'm sick? When I have backpain? I jotted down the process and doodled the interactions. I compared this to the existing design:</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/old-vs-new.png\">\n\n<h2>Design Solution</h2>\n<p>As shown in the flow chart above, I wanted the flow to mimic our real life interactions with a doctor. I made the following major changes to the flow:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Start with asking about their concern</li>\n  <li>Provide a list of options to choose from</li>\n  <li>Display doctors sorted by relevance, availability, and location</li>\n  <li>Remove all marketing/internal jargon</li>\n  <li>Minimize information overload</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-02.png\">\n\n<p>After outlining the main flow, I iterated on smaller details.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-03.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/iteration-04.png\">\n\n<h2>üî• Final Design üî•</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/final-flow.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/disection.png\">\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/askdocs/07-b.png\">\n\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Due to development prorities and timelines, some of the features, like the quick filter, did not ship. My goal is to continue the iterative process since there is still plenty of room for improvement. The good news is that our users are a lot less unahppy or confused about the Ask Docs flow.</p>\n";

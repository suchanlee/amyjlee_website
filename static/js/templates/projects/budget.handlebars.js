    return "<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p class=\"dsfjkl\">\n  One of the first things I struggled with after graduating from college was budgeting. \"Saving up\" sounded easy but by the end of the month, I was always at a net zero. I wasn't sure how to set finance goals, observe my spending pattern, and analyze them based on categories. I tried some finance/budget apps like <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mint</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-budget-original-fastest/id651896614?ign-mpt=uo%3D8\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Budget</a> but nothing totally satisfied my needs.\n</p>\n<p>Those apps were definitely good and feature-ful but I had my own criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Simple and easy to use</li>\n  <li>Follows the daily budget method</li>\n  <li>Super easy and fast to add transactions, but only manually (manually keeping track of transactions helps me be more aware of my budget)</li>\n  <li>No need to link my finance information to the application (credit cards, bank accounts, etc.)</li>\n  <li>No signing up</li>\n  <li>Sync data with other phones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apps like Mint were definitely too complex and required all my financial data with which I didn't feel comfortable. Daily Budget fit my needs the best, but it didn't sync with other phones without using iCloud and I hate using iCloud and didn't want to use iCloud just for this app. :/. Being able to sync is a must-have feature for me because my husband and I have combined our finances and are on a single budget.</p>\n\n<h2>Design Process</h2>\n<p>There were multiple facets to the product: onboarding, recording transactions, analytics, and connecting with other devices. It was important to carefully adjust to these layers but keep the design simple and quickly learnable.</p>\n<a href=\"/static/img/projects/budget/sketch.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img class=\"project-image\" src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/sketch.png\" alt=\"budget app sketches\">\n</a>\n\n<div class=\"project-details-container\">\n  <h3>Initial Take</h3>\n  <div class=\"project-details-third text\">\n    My initial take was to be more visual and analytics-focused, as shown on the preliminary mocks. Understanding the spending and saving patterns seemed as important as recording the daily expenses. But after more using the Daily Budget app more, I found that I rarely ever looked at the analytics and cared most about \"how much budget do I have left?\".\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"project-details-third\">\n    <a href=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old1.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old1.png\" alt=\"initial mock 1 for budget app\">\n    </a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"project-details-third\">\n    <a href=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old2.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old2.png\" alt=\"initial mock 2 for budget app\">\n    </a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"project-details-container\">\n  <h3>Second Round</h3>\n  <div class=\"project-details-third text\">\n    <p>After removing the analytics from the main page, I questioned the structure of a daily budget: shouldn't it be more specific? Knowing how much I can spend in certain categories seemed more useful. For instance, there could be a weekly budget for eating out or groceries.</p>\n    <p>But this direction clashed with the daily budgeting method and increased the complexity of the application.</p>\n    <p>So instead of trying to come up with a new and innovative way of recording and viewing spendings, I focused on simplification and adding the main feature missing from Daily Budget, sync.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"project-details-third\">\n    <a href=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old3.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/old3.png\" alt=\"initial mock 3 for budget app\">\n    </a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Final Mock</h2>\n<div class=\"centered-text\">\n  <video class=\"budget-video\" src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/full.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" preload=\"metadata\" controls></video>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"budget-interactions\">Interactions</h2>\n  <h3>Adding Expenses</h3>\n  <div class=\"budget-interaction-container centered-text\">\n    <div class=\"budget-interaction video\">\n      <video src=\"/static/img/projects/budget/adding_expense.mov\" controls></video>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"budget-interaction text\">\n      Adding expenses or extra income should be simple.

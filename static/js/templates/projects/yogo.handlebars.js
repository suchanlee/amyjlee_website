It provides a user-friendly UI for poll creation and an informative visualization of the results.</p>\n\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>Yogo started out as a project called <a href=\"http://bezzist.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bezzist</a> by a group of Cornell students in <a href=\"http://lifechanginglabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Life Changing Labs</a>. When Bezzist was first launched, it focused on creating and enhancing the Cornell campus community and was a very client-specific tool. Due to lower user-adoption, the team eventually stopped working on Bezzist. However, wanting to create a more general tool for poll creation, one of the enginners in the project decided to advance with the plans and asked me to help.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/oldbezzist.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Bezzist\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-50\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Screenshot of Bezzist</p>\n<p>The result of that is Yogo, a professional yet simple tool with clean UI and friendly UX to create and use polls super fast.</p>\n\n<p>While designing Yogo, the focus was put on simplifying user behavior and providing coherent and user data visualization. Because Yogo was no longer a part of a specific community, theu ser experience had to be simplified. In its Bezzist stages, it was meant to be a community that featured question-of-the-day’s and answers.</p>\n<p>Yet, it became clear that building a community solely through polls was far-fetched. Hence, for Yogo to be a long-standing platform, its experience had to be very simple. There are some great examples of survey platforms, such as Doodle, Google Polls, and Survey Monkey. But our goal was to even more simplify the experience. One of the first steps in simplifying the user behavior was removing all barriers to entry, such as the required registration in Bezzist. The problem with required registration was that it reinforced the big decision point that users would likely withdraw from.</p>\n<p>In addition to seamless experience, Yogo needed a great analytics and data visualization. A simple app doesn’t guarantee simple polls—user behaviors cannot be confined or assumed into a single action. While some might make a quick poll with three options, some might make a poll with 30 different options to choose from. And it is our goal to break down and translate the data into clear visuals. It would not only help the users to easily comprehend the collected information but also differentiate Yogo from other poll services.</p>\n\n<h2>Sketches</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/sketches.png\" alt=\"Yogo sketches\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Iterations</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/iterations.png\" alt=\"Yogo iterations\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p>Before I got to the final mocks, I went through multiple iterations only on the landing page. It was crucial to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages. Initially, I made something very similar to Doodle. It had a series of welcoming, tutorial, and set up pages until the actual poll page. At the time, I believed it was important to have a solid onboarding process to use the product and therefore the product became unnecessarily complicated. Then I realized Yogo should be simple enough that it does not need any onboarding process. Ultimately, I gutted away all the other pages but the poll page itself.</p>\n<p>In order to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages, I spent multiple iterations only on the landing page. Initially I made something similar to Doodle, consisting of a welcoming, tutorial, and setup pages leading to the actual poll page. At the time, I believed a solid onboarding process for the product was necessary. However, this made Yogo unnecessarily complicated, causing me to realize a critical point: Yogo should be simple enough to not need any onboarding process. Following true to my realization, I removed all the other pages and only kept the poll page itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Mock</h2>\n<div class=\"yogo-invision-container\">\n  <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/MK41WRNA6#/screens\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"yogo-invision-link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/MK41WRNA6#/screens\" target=\"_blank\"  class=\"yogo-invision-text\">Click to view interactive mock on InVision</a>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/mockup.png\" alt=\"Yogo iMac shot\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n</div>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/view1.png\" alt=\"Yogo poll creation and home page\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-100\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Poll creation and home page</p>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/view2.png\" alt=\"Yogo poll view\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-100\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Poll view</p>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/view3.png\" alt=\"Yogo analytics\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-100\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Poll analytics</p>\n\n<h2>Detailed Interactions</h2>\n<div class=\"yogo-detail\">\n  <img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/detail1_vote.png\" alt=\"Yogo detailed interaction: vote\" class=\"yogo-detail-image\">\n  <div class=\"yogo-detail-text\">\n    <h3>Vote</h3>\n    <p>Clicking on the arrow on the left will count as a vote.

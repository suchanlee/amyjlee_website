    return "<p>Yogo is an extremely simple and easy tool for creating and sending out one-time use polls. It provides a user-friendly UI for poll creation and an informative visualization of the results.</p>\n\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>Yogo started out as a project called <a href=\"http://bezzist.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bezzist</a> by a group of Cornell students in <a href=\"http://lifechanginglabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Life Changing Labs</a>. When Bezzist was first launched, it focused on creating and enhancing the Cornell campus community and was a very client-specific tool. Due to lower user-adoption, the team eventually stopped working on Bezzist. However, wanting to create a more general tool for poll creation, one of the enginners in the project decided to advance with the plans and asked me to help.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/oldbezzist.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Bezzist\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-50\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Screenshot of Bezzist</p>\n<p>The result of that is Yogo, a professional yet simple tool with clean UI and friendly UX to create and use polls super fast.</p>\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>While designing Yoho, I focused on:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Making the app immediately usable: requiring user information adds a layer between the application and the user and because we don’t need the user’s information to create a poll, it was removed.</li>\n  <li>Establishing coherent data visualization and analytics: in order to optimize the experience ultimately, it was important for the users to easily comprehend collected information.</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/landing.png\" alt=\"Yogo landing\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Landing page of Yogo. There is no need to sign up or enter email. Need to make a poll? Fire away.</p>\n\n<h2>Sketches</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/sketches.png\" alt=\"Yogo sketches\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Iterations</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/yogo/iterations.png\" alt=\"Yogo iterations\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p>Before I got to the final mocks, I went through multiple iterations only on the landing page. It was crucial to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages. Initially, I made something very similar to Doodle. It had a series of welcoming, tutorial, and set up pages until the actual poll page. At the time, I believed it was important to have a solid onboarding process to use the product and therefore the product became unnecessarily complicated. Then I realized Yogo should be simple enough that it does not need any onboarding process. Ultimately, I gutted away all the other pages but the poll page itself.</p>\n<p>In order to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages, I spent multiple iterations only on the landing page.

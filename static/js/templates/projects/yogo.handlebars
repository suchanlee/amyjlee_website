<p>Yogo is an extremely simple and easy tool for creating and sending out one-time use polls. It provides a user-friendly UI for poll creation and an informative visualization of the results.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Yogo started out as a project called <a href="http://bezzist.com" target="_blank">Bezzist</a> by a group of Cornell students in <a href="http://lifechanginglabs.com/" target="_blank">Life Changing Labs</a>. When Bezzist was first launched, it focused on creating and enhancing the Cornell campus community and was a very client-specific tool. Due to lower user-adoption, the team eventually stopped working on Bezzist. However, wanting to create a more general tool for poll creation, one of the engineers in the project decided to advance with the plans and asked me to help.</p>

<p>The result of that is Yogo, a professional yet simple tool with clean UI and friendly UX to create and use polls super fast.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>While designing Yogo, I focused on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Making the app immediately usable: requiring user information adds a layer between the application and the user and because we don’t need the user’s information to create a poll, it was removed.</li>
  <li>Establishing coherent data visualization and analytics: in order to optimize the experience ultimately, it was important for the users to easily comprehend collected information.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before I got to the final mocks, I went through multiple iterations only on the landing page. It was crucial to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages. Initially, I made something very similar to Doodle. It had a series of welcoming, tutorial, and set up pages until the actual poll page. At the time, I believed it was important to have a solid onboarding process to use the product and therefore the product became unnecessarily complicated. Then I realized Yogo should be simple enough that it does not need any onboarding process. Ultimately, I gutted away all the other pages but the poll page itself.</p>
<p>In order to understand the priority and hierarchy of the pages, I spent multiple iterations only on the landing page. Initially I made something similar to Doodle, consisting of a welcoming, tutorial, and setup pages leading to the actual poll page. At the time, I believed a solid onboarding process for the product was necessary. However, this made Yogo unnecessarily complicated, causing me to realize a critical point: Yogo should be simple enough to not need any onboarding process. Following true to my realization, I removed all the other pages and only kept the poll page itself.</p>

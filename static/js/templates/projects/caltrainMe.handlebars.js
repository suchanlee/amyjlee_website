    return "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/caltrainme\" target=\"_blank\">CaltrainMe</a> is a schedule app for Caltrain that runs along the Bay Area peninsula. It’s a handy app for those who commute via Caltrain on daily basis. It provides instant schedule, ride alerts, timetable, nearest station, and favorite stops. Yet, among these features I noticed that a lot of people only use a couple; mainly the instant schedule to see when the next train is coming and ride alerts on train delays. The app is nice—it does its job; perhaps too much. That’s what challenged me to rethink the app. </p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/caltrainme/caltrainme_2.jpg\" alt=\"old mock for caltrain me redesign\" class=\"project-image project-image-in-text image-width-70\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">An iteration of CaltrainMe which looked okay but didn't solve anything.</p>\n\n<p>Although it was just a personal project that I started for fun, I wasn’t satisfied after the initial design. It looked better than the current app but I wasn’t sure if it was necessarily better. Then I thought about how I used the app again. I usually check for the two stations, Redwood City and San Francisco. The only other feature I use is Riders Advisories for delays, which is a live feed from the Caltrain twitter account. The first thing I want to see when opening the app is the time for next train. Based on these priorities and behavior, I gave another try.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Mock</h2>\n<div class=\"project-detail-iframe-container\">\n  <iframe width=\"456\" height=\"940\" src=\"//invis.io/MF3BR3RJC\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen class=\"project-detail-iframe\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Preliminary Sketches</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/caltrainme/sketches.png\" alt=\"preliminary sketches for caltrain me\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Workflow</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/caltrainme/wf2.png\" alt=\"workflow image for caltrain me\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p>Second iteration focused more heavily on simplifying the usability and enhancing visibility. I wanted to condense a lot of unnecessary steps in the existing app to make the work flow more cohesive. For instance, I envision that once the stations are entered, the first thing shown after opening the app would be the results page. They can be changed but the app should remember your “favorite stops” without you having to designate them. Another example is the Caltrain Twitter feed integration. Instead of having a separate section pulling the feed, the delay notification should be integrated directly onto the schedule.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, information hierarchy was revisited. I realized current app doesn’t emphasize or stress certain information enough. After observing travel itineraries and ticket mockups for a reference, I noticed that there are certain elements more stressed than the others, such as departure time and station. </p>\n\n<h2>Annotated Diagram</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/caltrainme/local_disection.png\" alt=\"annotated diagram for caltrain me\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Mandatory In-Hand Shot</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/caltrainme/rendering.png\" alt=\"mandatory in-hand shot for caltrain me\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n";

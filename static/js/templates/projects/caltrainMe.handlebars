  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/caltrainme" target="_blank">CaltrainMe</a> is a schedule app for Caltrain, a train that runs up and down the Bay Area. The app is pretty handy—it does its job, but perhaps a little too much.  Its features include instant schedule, ride alerts, timetable, nearest station, and favorite stops. However, I noticed that only a couple of these features were actually used by many users. That’s what challenged me to rethink the app.</p>

  <h2>Design Process</h2>
  <p>My initial goal was to make the app look lighter and faster. Yet, I soon realized that this design challenged needed more than just some visual changes. Before jumping into designing or even sketching, I went through these procedures to fully understand the existing app:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Observation and Research</li>
    <li>Analysis on priorities and behavior</li>
    <li>Elimination or Addition of features</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Based on these following findings, I reconstructed information hierarchy, page layout, and features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most used the app to see when the next train was coming for their default station</li>
    <li>Riders Advisories or Caltrain Twitter feed was very important during train delays</li>
    <li>Color coding different train types do help (bullet vs local)</li>
    <li>Scroll behavior for selecting stations can be sometimes cumbersome</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After researching, I decided to focus improving the design for the average Caltrain commuter, whose origin and destination rarely change although the times in which they take the train may change from day to day.</p>

  <h2>Workflow</h2>

  </div>

  <p>The newly designed workflow is very 1-dimensional and simple: the user inputs their origin/destination stations and is provided with the next train they could take to get to their destination. The user could swipe in the results view upcoming trains. After the initial origin/destination input, the app would default to showing the results page when the app is opened.</p>

  <p>Key Features and Differences</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many features of the old CaltrainMe removed to support one workflow</li>
    <li>Cohesive Caltrain Twitter feed integration</li>
    <li>In-app display of relevant delays</li>
    <li>Much easier display of the type of train (bullet, local, etc.)</li>
    <li>Changed information hierarchy to emphasize important text and images</li>
  </ul>

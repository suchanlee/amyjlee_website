    return "<p>Chrome design is utilitarian and simple. Yet, I didn’t find the file download flow on Chrome very practical. It has a lot of unnecessary steps that could be minimized. And in particular, I didn't like the download bar which took up valuable horizontal screen real estate at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/screenshot01.png\" alt=\"chrome current download ui\" class=\"project-image image-width-80\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Is that download bar needed when there is only one downloaded item?</p>\n\n<p>Every download starts with a giant, blue arrow on the left. It slides down slowly to indicate your downloaded file is on the far left side of the download bar.  This download bar comes up every time a file is downloaded on Chrome. Once it comes up, it stays on unless it’s manually closed. This is what bothered me the most. Because it requires a specific action, it interrupts my experience on Chrome. Nonetheless, I find the download bar intrusive; the fact that it stays on the browser makes me wonder if Chrome is expecting me to download more files.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/screenshot02.png\" alt=\"Ugly downloads page\" class=\"project-image image-width-80 project-image-in-text\">\n<p>Another feature on the download bar that I find disappointing is lack of emphasis on download history. This history page is an archive with all the downloaded files and incidents, showing the URL and the downloaded file. Hence, even if you empty out your download folder, you can search and retrieve your files from here.</p>\n\n<h2>Sketches</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/chromedlsketches.png\" alt=\"Sketches for the chrome download redesign\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n\n<h2>Final Mockup</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/full.png\" alt=\"Final mockup for chrome download redesign\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p>So… what does the download bar really show? It has recently downloaded files, quick access to download history, and the status of current download. Are these all necessary? Downloading progress is important but they don’t need to be present at all times. Debating and measuring on priority of these factors helped me clear unnecessary items, ultimately leading me to remove the bar and replace with a collapsible menu bar. My proposal places a menu icon for downloads next to the Settings icon on the upper right side of the browser. This way, recently downloaded files can be accessed quickly and the download status can be integrated seamlessly.</p>\n\n<p>When a file is downloaded, a quick preview will come up on the upper right side. The download can be paused, canceled or resumed. Once download is finished, it will have two options available: Open or Open in Finder. Clicking on the Downloads icon in the menu bar will drop down recently downloaded files. Downloads history can also be accessed from the drop down menu.</p>\n\n<h2>Design Details</h2>\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/disection02-01.png\" alt=\"Design details for chrome download\" class=\"project-image image-width-100\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Dissected view of the downloader</p>\n\n<div class=\"project-image-in-text\">\n  <img class=\"project-image project-image-inline image-width-30\" src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/Layer42.png\" alt=\"Different states of download: downloading\">\n  <img class=\"project-image project-image-inline image-width-30\" src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/Layer46.png\" alt=\"Different states of download: one finished\">\n  <img class=\"project-image project-image-inline image-width-30\" src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/Layer47.png\" alt=\"Different states of download: both finished\">\n  <p class=\"project-image-caption\">Different states of download (processing, completed, and paused)</p>\n</div>\n\n<img src=\"/static/img/projects/chromedl/recentdl.png\" alt=\"Recent download view\" class=\"project-image image-width-40\">\n<p class=\"project-image-caption\">Recent downloads are available via Downloads tab in the menu bar.
